# BlackJackCSharp

This project is meant to create a blackjack game in C# that a user can interact with.
This game will allow as many players (as possible with a 52 card deck).

The code is written in a way that other games can be made from it with the use of interfaces.

Multiple winners are allowed:

Goals:

Try to get this on discord?
Add other games to it.
Add some sort of chip system, or betting?
